        <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
           <p class="pt-3">Over 180 million smallholder farmers make up 90% of the farming population and are responsible for 80% of the food produced. However, they are plagued by a lack of access to credit, quality inputs, and markets. These challenges have a direct impact on farmersâ€™ income, food security, food quality, and food affordability.</p>

               <div class="col-lg-6 col-12">
                   <p>After conducting thorough research involving approximately 10 existing investors as well as new investors, we have gained a clear understanding of the challenges they are facing. Based on the results we obtained, we have developed a persona to represent their needs and preferences. Our research methodology included surveys and in-depth studies to gather comprehensive insights.</p>

        <p class="justify">
        Given the geographical dispersion of our team across different countries, we opted to utilize the Affinity mapping technique. This approach enabled us to effectively organize data and ideas by their relationships and similarities. By leveraging this method, we fostered collaboration, identified patterns, and prioritized information, enabling us to work cohesively despite our physical distance.

    <h3>USABILITY STUDY FINDINGS</h3>
        <P class="justify">We conducted two usability studies, one unmoderated and one moderated, with a total of 10 participants. The website was designed to be used by both literate and illiterate investors, so we had five participants in each category. We made changes to the app based on the feedback we received, including repositioning some elements, changing colors, and adding new functionalities.</P>
        <p>
Here is a more detailed breakdown of the changes we made:</p>

<p><b>Repositioning of elements:</b> We repositioned some of the elements on the website's home screen to make them easier to find. For example, we moved the "Invest Now" button to a more prominent location.</p>
<p><b>Changing colors: </b>We changed the colors of some of the wesite's elements to make them more accessible to people with vision impairments. For example, we assigned each section on the home screen different color to make it easy to read.</p>
<p><b>Adding new functionalities:</b> We added some new functionalities to the website, such as the ability to save featured farmers and track investment progress.</p>
<p>
    We believe that the changes we made will make the app more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of investors. We are grateful for the feedback we received from the participants in our usability studies, and we will continue to make improvements to the app based on their feedback.</p>

   <p>In conclusion, the design process for the ADOPt app involved conducting user research, creating personas, conducting competitive analysis, sketching and prototyping, and conducting usability testing. Through this process, I was able to identify the key pain points and desires of users, and design an app that addresses those needs. The final result is an website that makes it easy for people to adopt a pet in few easy clicks. I learned a lot throughout the process, also gained valuable insights into the needs and preferences of my target audience, and I improved my design skills and knowledge of user-centered design principles.</p>
